# Space Forces 🚀

**Space Forces** is a 2D strategy and combat simulation game developed using **C++** and the **GlistEngine** (OpenGL-based framework). The game features real-time unit spawning, resource management, and dynamic enemy waves.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features
* **Real-time Strategy:** Players must manage resources to spawn ships during combat.
* **Dynamic Wave System:** Enemy difficulty scales over time.
* **Class-Based Combat:** Different ship types with unique attributes (Health, Damage, Speed).

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project demonstrates proficiency in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Memory Management** in C++.

### Key Structures
* **Ship Class (Base):** Handles common attributes like physics and rendering.
* **Inheritance:** `PlayerShip` and `EnemyShip` classes inherit from the base `Ship` class, implementing unique AI and control logic.
* **Object Management:** Utilizes `std::vector` for managing active game objects and pointers for efficient memory usage.

### Engine & Tools
* **Language:** C++
* **Graphics:** OpenGL (via GlistEngine)
* **IDE:** Eclipse
